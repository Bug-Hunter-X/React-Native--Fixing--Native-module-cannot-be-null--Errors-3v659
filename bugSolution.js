The solution depends on the specific native module causing the error. Common fixes include:

**1. Verify Library Installation and Linking:**
   - Ensure the library is correctly installed using npm or yarn: `npm install react-native-camera` or `yarn add react-native-camera`
   - For iOS, run `pod install` in the iOS directory of your project.
   - Android might need manual linking, following instructions from the library's documentation (often involving modifying `android/settings.gradle`, `android/app/build.gradle` and sometimes adding the native module to the `MainApplication.java` file).

**2. Check Native Module Configuration:**
    - The `MainApplication.java` (for Android) file should correctly import and register the native module (this often involves adding a line like `new YourNativeModulePackage()` within the `getPackages()` method).

**3. Version Compatibility:**
   - Ensure all dependencies have compatible versions. Check the library's documentation for specific version requirements.

**4. Clean and Rebuild:**
   - Clean the project cache: `npm start -- --reset-cache`
   - Sometimes, a clean rebuild (sometimes requiring closing the metro bundler) fixes transient errors.

**Example Solution (react-native-camera):**

In `bugSolution.js`, the library would be imported and used correctly after the above steps were performed, leading to successful execution.  The critical point is ensuring that the native modules are properly linked (for iOS) or configured in the `MainApplication.java` file (for Android).
