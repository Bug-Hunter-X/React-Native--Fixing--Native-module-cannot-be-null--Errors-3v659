# React Native: Resolving "Native module cannot be null" Errors

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development where native modules fail to integrate correctly, resulting in the dreaded "Native module cannot be null" error.  The examples include scenarios involving common libraries like react-native-camera. The solutions illustrate effective strategies to address linking issues, version mismatches, and other factors that can lead to this problem. We cover both Android and iOS configurations.  The `bug.js` file shows the error-causing code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the respective files for each platform (Android/iOS) to recreate the error scenario.
3. Then, implement the solutions provided in the `bugSolution.js` file to verify the fix.
