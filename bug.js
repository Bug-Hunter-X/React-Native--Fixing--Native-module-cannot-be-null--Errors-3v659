This error occurs when using a library that requires specific native modules, but those modules are not properly linked or configured within your React Native project.  It often surfaces during the build process or when attempting to initialize the library.  The exact error message might vary, but it usually points to missing native code or a failure to integrate the library correctly. For instance, when trying to use react-native-camera, you might encounter a variation of the error "Native module cannot be null". This often stems from issues in the linking process between your JavaScript code and the native Android/iOS components.  Another scenario is an incorrect installation or mismatched versions of native libraries.
